- 👋 Hi, I’m @PapaJS(JC Smith)
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to program and code at a late age in retirement.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, how to type better, how to use Git and Github.
- I started several years back developing websites with HTML. Need to refresh and update skills in that area.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on learning skills and exercises for now.
- 📫 How to reach me ... jcsmith.tn@gmail.com
